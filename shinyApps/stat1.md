<span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:2em;">The Dataset</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.1em;">The original data set was obtained from the CDC website, under the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, following this [link](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2017.html). The data set has 450,016 observations for 358 variables including records of respondents' answers and calculated variables that categorized original data points into groups represented by an integer each. </span>

<span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.1em;">From 358 variables available, this project selected and worked with only demographic and lifestyle factors believed to associate with asthma by scientific research.</span>


<span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.1em;">Common risk factors associated with asthma include genetic factors, allergies, bad air quality where patients live or work, smoking, and weight status (Mayo Clinic, 2018). According to WebMD, "people with asthma have twice the risk of developing mood and anxiety disorder, including depression" (Bruce, 2009). Previous statistical research has shown that asthma is very common among young adults and adults from age 6 to 40 (NCHS, 2012). Partly because of the risk factors, asthma tends to be more common among the lower income group. Socioeconomic factors and ethnicity are strongly correlated, making income, education level and race demographic factors to be considered while exploring trends in asthma prevalence in the U.S. population. </span>

<span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.1em;">In short, factors related to asthma include, but not limited to: **_State_**, **_Sex_**, **_Age_**, **_Race_**, **_BMI_**, **_Education Level_**, **_Income Group_**, **_Smoker Status_**, **_Physical Activities_**, and **_Depressive Disorders_**. The desired data set for this App  narrows down to these ten variables, and ten other variables describing conditions related to current and former asthma patients. </span>

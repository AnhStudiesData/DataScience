<span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.1em;">Millions of Americans are affected by asthma every year. Asthma is a very common chronic respiratory disease where a person's airways to the lung are inflamed, narrowed, swollen, and often produce extra thickened mucus which make breathing difficult (Mayo Clinic, 2018). Asthma may not pose a major problem to some people, but for others, it can gravely interfere with daily activities. An asthma-attack can be life-threatening. </span>

<span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.1em;">Studying demographic trends and risk factors associated with asthma is important for asthma prevention measures, and treatments of asthma symptoms. Understanding the medical needs of asthma patients, in which states were asthma patients most and least likely to be found, is important for asthma prevention measures, and reliefs of asthma symptoms. Furthermore, having an algorithm to accurately predict who would be more in danger of suffering from asthma, will be extremely beneficial to medical providers to devise prevention methods, and better prepare and allocate resources for diagnosis and necessary treatments. </span>

<span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:1.1em;">The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a state-based cross-sectional telephone survey initiated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The state health departments have been conducting the survey monthly over land-lines and cellular telephones using a standardized questionnaire and other assistance from the CDC. The survey data sets contain relevant data that are useful for asthma analysis under the scope of this project. </span>
